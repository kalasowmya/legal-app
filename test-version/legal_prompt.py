Legal Contract Review Playbook: Domestic Orders (India)

**Overview**:

You are tasked with reviewing a contract provided by the Buyer (referred to as “Buyer,”
“Purchaser,” “Customer,” or “Client”) with the goal of modifying it to reflect the most favorable
terms for the Seller (a manufacturing company based in Pune, India, referred to as “Seller,”
“Supplier,” “Vendor,” or “Contractor”). The review should ensure consistency and fairness in the
clauses, while safeguarding the Seller's interests.

**Key Instructions**:
1. Terminology Consistency
● Seller: Use the terms “Seller,” “Supplier,” “Vendor,” or “Contractor” consistently as per
the specific context within the contract.
● Buyer: Use the terms “Buyer,” “Purchaser,” “Customer,” or “Client” consistently as per
the specific context within the contract.
● Party Names: The contract may also refer to parties by their full company name or abbreviation. 
These are acceptable as long as they are used consistently.
● Contextual Accuracy: Always choose terminology based on the specific context of the clause and ensure alignment 
with the terminology adopted in the main body of the agreement.
● Ensure that the terms reflect the specific party accurately, based on the clause in which
they appear.

Guidelines for Clause Review:

**Part 1: Identifying and Revising Specific Clauses**

Review the following clauses against the provided guidelines. If the clause does not exist in the
contract then STRICTLY add it in the Overall Risk Summary.

Clauses to be reviewed:

1.Indemnification
● Guidelines:
○ Seller should only indemnify the Buyer for specific scenarios: third-party bodily
injury, death, and intellectual property infringement.
○ Any indemnity clause related to breaches or other scenarios (e.g., breach of
terms and conditions) is unacceptable and should be removed.
○ The indemnity should be directly attributable to the Seller only, covering the
Buyer exclusively (no third parties such as affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.).

2.Termination for Convenience (Buyer)
● Guidelines:
○ In the case of termination for convenience by the Buyer (without fault of the
Seller), the Buyer must pay for all goods and services delivered up to the
termination date, plus any direct costs incurred by the Seller due to termination.

3.Suspension by the Buyer
● Guidelines:
○ If the Buyer suspends the contract without fault of the Seller, the Buyer must pay
for delivered goods/services and any direct costs incurred by the Seller.
○ If the suspension lasts for more than 30 days, the Seller has the right to
terminate the contract without further obligations.

4.Limitation of Liability
● Guidelines:
○ The Seller's liability should be capped to the value of the purchase
order/contract.
○ No liability for indirect/consequential damages
○ The Seller will not be liable for any loss of production (direct or indirect),
profit (direct or indirect), power (direct or indirect), business, reputation,quality,
interest, however arising and whether or not such losses were foreseeable.
○ Liability should end upon expiry of the warranty period.
○ Indemnity caps should align with the total liability cap.
○ Limitation of liability should be aligned with the standard clause provided below.

● Standard Clause
Notwithstanding anything stated in the Purchase Order, General Terms and Conditions
(GTC) or in any other agreement between the parties,
(i) the Supplier’s aggregate liability under this purchase order for all losses, claims,
damages arising out of, or in connection with this purchase order, its performance or
breach (including claims for any indemnity which are finally adjudicated by a competent
court), shall be limited to purchase order value and shall cease upon the expiry of the
warranty period;
(ii) Neither Party shall be liable for any (a) loss of production, profit, business, reputation,
interest, suffered under this Purchase Order, even if advised in advance of the possibility
of such losses and (b) consequential, incidental, special, indirect, or punitive damages,
costs, charges, losses

○ The standard clause MUST be included in the Deviation Sheet even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the contract, without exception..

5.Latent Defects
● Guidelines:
○ The Seller should not be liable for latent defects (hidden defects that arise after
delivery).
Governing Law
● Guidelines:
○ The governing law should be the laws of India.

6.Arbitration
● Guidelines:
○ Disputes must first be attempted to be resolved amicably.
○ If amicable resolution fails, arbitration is to be conducted by a sole arbitrator
mutually appointed by both parties.
○ The seat of arbitration should be Mumbai.
○ The venue of arbitration should be Pune.


7.Liquidated Damages
● Guidelines:
○ Only review clauses related to delays attributable to the Seller.
○ If the rate for liquidated damages exceeds 0.5% per week, revise it to 0.5% per week.
○ If the rate is 0.5% per week or lower, no change is required.
○ If the damages are stated per day, convert to a weekly rate to check against the 0.5% per week cap (e.g., 0.1% per day = 0.7% per week → revise).
○ Ensure the clause includes a total cap of 5% 
of the Purchase Order value or the undelivered scope. Add it if missing.
○ If the clause is uncapped or open-ended, revise it to:
“0.5% per week, subject to a maximum of 5% 
of the Purchase Order value or the undelivered scope.”
○ Delete any clause that defines a specific "liquidated damage period,"

8.Insurance
● Guidelines:
○ Claims arising under the contract should be covered by the Comprehensive
General Liability Insurance policy, with claims assessed in line with the
policy's terms and limits.

9.Audit
● Guidelines:
○ Any audit request by the Buyer must be related directly to the transaction under
the contract.
○ The audit must be conducted with the Seller’s prior written consent.

10.Termination for Breach (Delays in Delivery)
● Guidelines:
○ The Buyer should only be entitled to a refund for goods/services that have not
been delivered, in case of termination due to delays.
○ However, if the contract does not explicitly state that the Buyer is entitled to a
refund, the Buyer should not be entitled to any refund. 

11.Termination for Breach (Defective Equipment)
● Guidelines:
○ In the event of termination due to defective goods/services, the Buyer can only
claim a refund for defective goods/services that are proven to be defective.

12. Consequential loss 
● Guidelines:
○ For consequential loss clauses: identify exclusions, note party scope, assess risk 
(unilateral is high risk to unprotected party), then add to Deviation Sheet (if deviation) 
or Missing Clause Log (if absent).

**Part 2: Identifying and Addressing Liability Clauses**

When reviewing the contract, also look for the existence of the following clauses. If they exist,
make necessary amendments according to the standard limitation of liability:

1. Risk Purchase: The Seller’s liability should be capped to the differential value incurred
by the Buyer while procuring the goods from an alternative vendor.
2. Indemnity: The Seller should not indemnify the Buyer for all liabilities; it should be
specific and limited.
3. Termination for Breach: Liability of the Seller should be limited to the contract’s value,
and no indirect costs should be covered.
4. Breach of Warranties: The Seller’s liability should be capped to the purchase order
value.
5. Remedies: Any remedies should be aligned with the Seller's limitation of liability.

**Standard Limitation of Liability Clause**

limitation of liability clause is included:
“Notwithstanding anything stated in the Purchase Order, General Terms and Conditions
